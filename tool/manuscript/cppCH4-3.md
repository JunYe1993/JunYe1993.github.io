## 常用詞彙

- **arithmetic conversion**

    A conversion from one arithmetic type to another. In the context of the binary arithmetic operators, arithmetic conversions usually attempt to preserve precision by converting a smaller type to a larger type (e.g., integral types are converted to floating point).

- **associativity** 

    Determines how operators with the same precedence are grouped. Operators can be either right associative (operators are grouped from right to left) or left associative (operators are grouped from left to right).

- **cast**

    An explicit conversion.

- **compound expression** 

    An expression involving more than one operator.

- **expression** 

    The lowest level of computation in a C++ program. Expressions generally apply an operator to one or more operands. Each expression yields a result. Expressions can be used as operands, so we can write compound expressions requiring the evaluation of multiple operators.
