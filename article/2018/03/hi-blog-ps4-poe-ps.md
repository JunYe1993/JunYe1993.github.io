Now that she's back in the atmosphere
就在剛剛她已回到空氣中
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
帶著沾著木星塵埃的頭髮
She acts like summer and walks like rain
她的舉止像夏天一般熱情，走起路來像雨一般溫柔
Reminds me that there's time to change
提醒著我還年輕能去改變
Since the return from her stay on the moon
自從她從月球回來
She listens like spring and talks like June
她像春天一般地聆聽，像六月一般的喧囂

But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
先告訴我，你是否曾穿梭在太陽中
Did you make it to the Milky Way
你是否曾到達銀河
To see the lights all faded
看到了星光沒有如此燦爛
And that heaven is overrated?
發現天堂沒有如此美好
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
告訴我你是否曾傾心於一顆無瑕的流星
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?
當你在那追尋自我時是否曾想念過我


Now that she's back from that soul vacation
就在剛剛她結束她的靈魂之旅
Tracing her way through the constellation
在星座中追尋著她
She's checked out Mozart while she does Tae Bo
她邊聽著 Mozart 邊做 Tae Bo
(註：作Tae-bo這種運動時，通常會放Hi-Hop的音樂。但媽媽的心中，響起的卻是節奏穩定的莫扎特音樂。故本句暗示，母親的內心堅定，不受嘈雜的外界噪音影響) 
Reminds me that there's room to grow
提醒著我還年輕能去成長
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
就在剛剛她已回到空氣中
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
我害怕她認為我是平庸之人
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly

So he never did land


But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?


Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance
Freeze dried romance, five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me


But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded?
And that heaven is overrated
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?


And did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
Oh and did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star
And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?

(註：雙關語，Venus=金星=女神)
(註：在作者的文化中，炸雞是父母親常買給小孩吃的comfort food，所以這種食物在這裡，暗示著『愛與體貼』)
(註：豆漿拿鐵淡而無味，但他的愛情關係比豆漿拿鐵更無味。所以豆漿拿鐵在約會的時候，反而變成人間美味)
